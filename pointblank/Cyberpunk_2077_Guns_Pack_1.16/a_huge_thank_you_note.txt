Recently, I've been going through some very tough times. It's just been
hard to get through life lately with all of the bad things happening all
at once.

I've been working hard on this project as a form of a coping mechanism 
because of the constant stress I have been dealing with for the past year, 
and I just want to say thank you. Thank you for supporting me by
downloading my content pack and enjoying it. You have no idea how much
this means to me.

Yeah, stress is still at an all time high. But knowing that there's
people enjoying my creations just makes that stress so much easier to
manage.

Again, thank you so so much.
