hide all items in recipe viewer that don't replace existing items in your modpack.

e.g. if '#forge:gears/ruby' tag has any entries from another mod,
then the emendatus ruby gear will be unhidden
(does not hide generated items with self added flags)

NOTE: this kinda sucks rn cus itll hide stuff with autogenned recipes, I should-
add manual overrides or just replace this behavior ngl
